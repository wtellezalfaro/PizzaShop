# PizzaShop

The Solutions has two projects
- Pizza Shop
	It's a WEB API Project which implements rest services to solve the requierments
	This project also has an Entity Framework generated code which we use in the model
	

- Pizza Shop Client is a windows service app that runs as a client of the restful services

Data is stored in a  SQL Server DataBase

The soluction could be bigger, but for excersise purposes we leave as it 

We are using additional libraries like NewtonSoft and Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client Package
